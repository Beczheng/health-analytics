A primer for 504/507

There are three patients: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. To store each patient's information, dictionaries were used. Nested within the dictionaries are more dictionaries showing the medical tests for each patient. For example, each patient had undergone a blood and urine test.

To generate an output for the blood and urine test results for each patient, if/elif/else statements and functions were used. The expected output includes the patient's full name, a numerical representation of their results, and a corresponding description of those results.
